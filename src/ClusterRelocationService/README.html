<h1 id="x4-cluster-relocation-service">X4 Cluster Relocation
Service</h1>
<p><strong>Transform the entire Galaxy with a single click!</strong></p>
<p>This tool allows you to relocate clusters in the X4: Foundations game
universe. It provides a user-friendly interface to select clusters,
define new locations, and update the game data accordingly.</p>
<p>After relocating clusters, you can save the changes as a mod
(<code>Relocated Clusters</code>) that can be easily loaded into the
game.</p>
<p><strong>If you tired of to play in nasty known galaxy - simple press
a button, and you will not find any sector on a map :-)</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the Cluster per Cluster relocation, the tool also
allows you to <code>Make a "Full Mess"</code> in the galaxy by
relocating all clusters in one go to random locations.</p>
<p>It based on funny “hidden” feature of the game engine, which allows
you to define or breaks new locations of the clusters without any
influence on a game stability and processes. The relocation mod is not
affecting on you save games, so you can safely remove/change it at any
time.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<li>Option to relocate all clusters randomly in one go.</li>
<li>Validation of new locations to ensure they are valid within the game
universe.</li>
<li>Can be used to resolve the issue with overlaid clusters, when
several clusters have equal coordinates.</li>
<li>Can be used by modders to simplify relocation of their
clusters.</li>
<li>Dedicated overlaid clusters browser with at-a-glance visibility
highlighting and one-click map centering.</li>

<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<h3 id="direct-mode">Direct Mode</h3>
<p>In the Direct Mode, you just need to select the game folder and start
playing with the Clusters relocation. In this case the tool will load
the game data directly from the game files. The mod will be saved in the
game <code>Extensions</code> folder, under
<code>relocated_clusters</code> folder.</p>
<h4 id="direct-mode-first-start">Direct Mode First Start</h4>
<p>On the first start, the tool will inform you that you need to select
the game folder, and will switch to the options menu tab. If you will
unselect <code>Direct Mode</code> - you will go via start process in
“Expert” mode: <a href="#first-start-in-the-expert-mode">First Start in
the “Expert” Mode</a> section.</p>
<p>After selecting the game folder, the tool will start loading the game
data. <img src="docs/images/first_start.gif"
alt="First start in Direct Mode" /></p>
<h4 id="direct-mode-first-mod-creation">Direct Mode First Mod
Creation</h4>
<p>After loading the game data, you will see the main window and the
Galaxy Map. Please take in account - the Sectors ownership is equal to
the initial game state, without any changes from the current save. When
you will be finish with the connections, you can save the mod via the
<code>Mod</code> -&gt; <code>Save</code> menu item. Mod will be saved in
the game <code>Extensions</code> folder, under
<code>relocated_clusters</code> folder.</p>
<h4 id="direct-mode-second-and-other-starts">Direct Mode Second and
Other starts</h4>
<p>On the next starts tool will automatically load not only game data,
but also the “Relocated Clusters” mod data. So, after starting you will
see the the map with the already relocated clusters.</p>
<p>You can cancel the existing relocation, or add new, or relocated
already relocated clusters.</p>
<p>After that you can save the mod via the <code>Mod</code> -&gt;
<code>Save</code> menu item.</p>

<p>At any time you can switch between the Direct Mode and the “Expert”
Mode. Just go to the options menu and select or unselect the
<code>Direct Mode</code> checkbox. Always will reload the game data and

directly.</p>
<h3 id="main-window">Main Window</h3>
<p>After starting, you will see the main window with a Galaxy Map.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Main window</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="galaxy-map">Galaxy Map</h4>
<p>The Galaxy Map allows you to navigate through various sectors in the
game. You can zoom in and out to view details about each sector and the
gates within them. Using the map, you can select sectors to use in the
gate connections.</p>
<p>For zooming, there are two options available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the slider at the top of the map.</li>
<li>Use the mouse wheel while holding the <code>Ctrl</code> key.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can drag the map with the left mouse button when it
is zoomed in.</p>
<p>When you click the any mouse button on a Cluster(or Sector) - it will
show the <code>Context Menu</code> with the options to
<code>Mark for Relocation</code> or <code>Cancel Relocation</code> (if
the cluster is already relocated).</p>
<p>If there any overlaid clusters (clusters that occupy the same space)
- they will be highlighted by <code>OrangeRed</code> border on the
map.</p>
<h5 id="relocating-a-cluster">Relocating a Cluster</h5>
<p>To relocate a cluster, you have to make a two-step process:</p>

<h6 id="overlaid-clusters">Overlaid Clusters</h6>
<p>If there are any overlaid clusters (clusters that occupy the same
space), they will be highlighted by <code>OrangeRed</code> border on the
map. Context menu item <code>Mark for Relocation</code> will show as
visible on map cluster, as well as a list of underlying clusters below
it.</p>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/context_menu_if_overlaid.png"

another cluster, the cancellation will not be possible. And this menu
item will be disabled.</p>
<h4 id="relocated-clusters-list">Relocated Clusters List</h4>
<p>On the bottom of the main window, there is a list of relocated
clusters. This list provides an overview of all clusters that have been

press the “Yes” button.</li>
<li>Extract the game files. If you don’t have the game files extracted,
you can press the “No” button to initiate the extraction.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="with-extracted-game-files">With Extracted Game Files</h5>
<p>After selecting the folder, the tool will start loading the game
data.</p>

href="https://wiki.egosoft.com:1337/X4%20Foundations%20Wiki/Modding%20Support/X%20Catalog%20Tool/">X
Catalog Tool</a>.</p>
<h5 id="without-extracted-game-files">Without Extracted Game Files</h5>
<p>You will be forwarded to the menu containing the button to start the

</ul>
<p>There are several options to extract the game files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extract only needed data - this will extract only the data needed
for the tool to work. It will be faster than the full extraction.</li>
<li>Verify extracted data - this will check the consistency of the
extracted data. Recommended to use it every time you extract the
data.</li>
<li>Overwrite existing files - this will overwrite the existing files in
the output folder. Again, recommended to use it every time you extract
the data.</li>
<li>Set as source and load after extraction - this will set the
extracted folder as the source for the game data and load it after the
extraction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can unselect some DLC’s or Mods, if you don’t want
to extract them.</p>
<h5 id="reloading-the-game-data">Reloading the Game Data</h5>
<p>If you need to reload the game data, especially if the Mod or DLC was
updated (for example, if you are mod developer, and want to know how the
galaxy map will look after your changes) - you can do it via the
<code>X4 Data</code> -&gt; <code>Reload</code> menu item.</p>
