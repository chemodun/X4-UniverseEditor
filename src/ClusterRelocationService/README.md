# X4 Cluster Relocation Service

**Transform the entire Galaxy with a single click!**

This tool allows you to relocate clusters in the X4: Foundations game universe. It provides a user-friendly interface to select clusters, define new locations, and update the game data accordingly.

After relocating clusters, you can save the changes as a mod (`Relocated Clusters`) that can be easily loaded into the game.

In addition to the Cluster per Cluster relocation, the tool also allows you to `Make a "Full Mess"` in the galaxy by relocating all clusters in one go to random locations.

It based on funny "hidden" feature of the game engine, which allows you to define or breaks new locations of the clusters without any influence on a game stability and processes. The relocation mod is not affecting on you save games, so you can safely remove/change it at any time.

![Main window](docs/images/main_window.png)

#### Galaxy Map

The Galaxy Map allows you to navigate through various sectors in the game. You can zoom in and out to view details about each sector and the gates within them. Using the map, you can select sectors to use in the gate connections.

For zooming, there are two options available:

- Use the slider at the top of the map.
- Use the mouse wheel while holding the `Ctrl` key.

Additionally, you can drag the map with the left mouse button when it is zoomed in.

When you click the any mouse button on a Cluster(or Sector) - it will show the `Context Menu` with the options to `Mark for Relocation` or `Cancel Relocation` (if the cluster is already relocated).

##### Relocating a Cluster

To relocate a cluster, you have to make a two-step process:

![Relocating Clusters](docs/images/relocating_clusters.gif)

###### Marking a Cluster for Relocation

To relocate a cluster, simply click on the desired cluster on the Galaxy Map and select `Mark for Relocation` from the context menu. This action will mark the cluster for relocation, and it will be highlighted on the map.
In addition, the cell grid will be shown on the map to help you visualize the new location.

###### Choosing a New Location

After marking a cluster for relocation, click on the desired empty cell on the map where you want to move the cluster. And again, a context menu will appear. Select `Relocate Here` to move the cluster to the new location.

###### Magic

And that's it! The cluster will be relocated to the new position, and the map will update to reflect the change.
Cluster will be marked by Blue border on the map.

Previously  relocated cluster will be marked by Green border on the map.

###### Unmark a Cluster

If you change your mind and decide not to relocate a cluster, simply click on the marked cluster again and select `Unmark for Relocation` from the context menu. This action will unmark the cluster.

Or simply `Mark` any other cluster - the previously marked one will be unmarked automatically.

##### Canceling a Relocation

If you want to revert a relocation and return a cluster to its original position, click on the relocated cluster and select `Cancel Relocation` from the context menu. This action will move the cluster back to its initial location.

Please note that if the original position is already occupied by another cluster, the cancellation will not be possible. And this menu item will be disabled.

#### Relocated Clusters List

On the bottom of the main window, there is a list of relocated clusters. This list provides an overview of all clusters that have been relocated, including their names, macro ids, original and new coordinates.

##### Canceling a Relocation from the List

To cancel a relocation from the list, simply select the desired cluster in the list and click the `Cancel Relocation` button located right next to the list. This action will revert the selected cluster to its original position.

##### Focusing on the Map from the List

To focus on a specific relocated cluster on the map, select the desired cluster in the list and the border of the selected item will be highlighted on the map as in a list.

##### Exporting the map to the image file (png)

You can export the current view of the Galaxy Map to a PNG image file. This feature allows you to save and share the map view with others or use it for reference in your projects. To export the map, simply click the "Export Galaxy Map as PNG" button located at the top right corner of the Galaxy Map interface.

Thanks to [@Sleaker](https://steamcommunity.com/id/sleaker) for the idea and initial implementation for the [Chem Gate Builder](https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/1587/) mod.

##### Hiding and showing the DLC's and Mods on a map

You can toggle the visibility of DLCs and Mods on the map to focus on your current editing tasks.

### Full Mess Relocation

You can enable or disable the "Full Mess" option, which allows you to relocate all clusters randomly in one go.
When enabled, you will see a button `Make a "Full Mess"` under the `Cancel Relocation` button, in the right side of the relocated clusters list.

When you press it, all clusters will be relocated one by one to random cells on the map.

![Full Mess Relocation](docs/images/make_a_full_mess.gif)

### Save the Mod

When you finish with the connections, you can save the mod via the `Mod` -> `Save` menu item. Please ensure you have completed all necessary edits before saving to avoid losing data.
After that, the mod will be saved/updated in the appropriate subfolder in the `Extensions` folder of the game.

On the first start, the tool will inform you that you need to select the folder with the game files.

If you will unselect the `Direct Mode` - you will go via the start process described below.

And when you press a button to select the folder, the tool will propose two ways to do it:

- Extract the game files. If you don't have the game files extracted, you can press the "No" button to initiate the extraction.

##### With Extracted Game Files

After selecting the folder, the tool will start loading the game data.

![First start](docs/images/)

There is a link on wiki related to the tool for the extraction - [X Catalog Tool](https://wiki.egosoft.com:1337/X4%20Foundations%20Wiki/Modding%20Support/X%20Catalog%20Tool/).

##### Without Extracted Game Files

You will be forwarded to the menu containing the button to start the extraction. Please press it to start the extraction.
Now everything is simple:

- Select the folder with the game files.
- Select the folder where will be placed new folder with the extracted game files. It will be created automatically with a name containing the current game version. Like "X4v800-extracted".
- Press the "Extract Data" button.

![First start with Extraction](docs/images/)

There are several options to extract the game files:

- Extract only needed data - this will extract only the data needed for the tool to work. It will be faster than the full extraction.
- Verify extracted data - this will check the consistency of the extracted data. Recommended to use it every time you extract the data.
- Overwrite existing files - this will overwrite the existing files in the output folder. Again, recommended to use it every time you extract the data.
- Set as source and load after extraction - this will set the extracted folder as the source for the game data and load it after the extraction.

Additionally, you can unselect some DLC's or Mods, if you don't want to extract them.

##### Reloading the Game Data

If you need to reload the game data, especially if the Mod or DLC was updated (for example, if you are mod developer, and want to know how the galaxy map will look after your changes) - you can do it via the `X4 Data` -> `Reload` menu item.
