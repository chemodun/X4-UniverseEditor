<h1 id="x4-chem-gate-builder">X4 Chem Gate Builder</h1>
<p>This tool allows you to build gate connections for the game X4
Foundations. It helps players create connections between any sectors in
the game. The tool generates a mod (extension) for the game, which can
be easily installed and uninstalled.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Build gate connections between any sectors in the game.</li>
<li>Select sectors from a list or from the Galaxy map.</li>
<li>Create any number of connections, where a connection is a pair of
gates in two sectors.</li>
<li>Easily arrange the location of gates in sectors by moving them on
the map using the mouse.</li>
<li>Direct mode - when you need only to select a game folder and start
building connections. Nothing to extract.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Anyone can use the gate connections built by this tool in their mods
or simply in the game. If you use the connections in mods, please
mention the author and the tool in the mod description.</p>
<h2 id="download">Download</h2>
<p>You can download the tool from the following locations:</p>
<ul>
<li><a
href="https://github.com/chemodun/X4-UniverseEditor/releases">Releases
on GitHub</a></li>
<li><a
href="https://www.nexusmods.com/x4foundations/mods/1587/">Nexus</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>Simply <a href="#download">download</a> the latest version and
extract it to any folder.</p>
<p>You can start building your connections right away.</p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<h3 id="direct-mode">Direct Mode</h3>
<p>In the Direct Mode, you don’t need to extract the game files. You
just need to select the game folder and start building the connections.
In this case the tool will load the game data directly from the game
files. And will work only with the “Chem Gate Keeper” mod in the game
<code>Extensions</code> folder. You will be able only to save it,
without possibility to select its location.</p>
<h4 id="direct-mode-first-start">Direct Mode First Start</h4>
<p>On the first start, the tool will inform you that you need to select
the game folder, and will switch to the options menu tab. If you will
unselect <code>Direct Mode</code>- you will go via start process
described below in the <a href="#first-start">First Start</a>
section.</p>
<p>After selecting the game folder, the tool will start loading the game
data. <img src="docs/images/first_start_direct_mode.gif"
alt="First start in Direct Mode" /></p>
<p>Available from <code>version 0.9.0</code>.</p>
<h4 id="direct-mode-first-mod-creation">Direct Mode First Mod
Creation</h4>
<p>After loading the game data, you will see the main window and can
start building the Gate connections. When you will be finish with the
connections, you can save the mod via the <code>Mod</code> -&gt;
<code>Save</code> menu item. Mod will be saved in the game
<code>Extensions</code> folder.</p>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/first_gate_direct_mode.gif"
alt="First mod creation in Direct Mode" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">First mod creation in Direct
Mode</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="direct-mode-second-and-other-starts">Direct Mode Second and
Other starts</h4>
<p>On the next starts tool will automatically load not only game data,
but also the “Chem Gate Keeper” mod data. So, after starting you will
see the main window with the connections from the mod.</p>
<p>You can update the connections, add new ones, or remove the existing
ones. After that you can save the mod via the <code>Mod</code> -&gt;
<code>Save</code> menu item.</p>
<figure>

alt="Second and other starts in Direct Mode" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Second and other starts in Direct
Mode</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="direct-mode-to-usual-mode-and-vice-versa">Direct Mode To Usual
Mode and Vice Versa</h4>
<p>At any time you can switch between the Direct Mode and the Usual
Mode. Just go to the options menu and select or unselect the
<code>Direct Mode</code> checkbox. In some cases it will require to load
the extracted game data again.</p>
<h3 id="first-start">First Start</h3>
<p>On the first start, the tool will inform you that you need to select
the folder with the game files.</p>
<p>If you will unselect the <code>Direct Mode</code> - you will go via
the start process described below.</p>
<p>And when you press a button to select the folder, the tool will
propose two ways to do it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the extracted game folder. If you already have it - simply
press the “Yes” button.</li>
<li>Extract the game files. If you don’t have the game files extracted,
you can press the “No” button to initiate the extraction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="with-extracted-game-files">With Extracted Game Files</h3>
<p>After selecting the folder, the tool will start loading the game
data.</p>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/first_start.gif" alt="First start" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">First start</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is a link on wiki related to the tool for the extraction - <a
href="https://wiki.egosoft.com:1337/X4%20Foundations%20Wiki/Modding%20Support/X%20Catalog%20Tool/">X
Catalog Tool</a>.</p>
<h3 id="without-extracted-game-files">Without Extracted Game Files</h3>
<p>You will be forwarded to the menu containing the button to start the
extraction. Please press it to start the extraction. Now everything is
simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the folder with the game files.</li>
<li>Select the folder where will be placed new folder with the extracted
game files. It will be created automatically with a name containing the
current game version. Like “X4v710-extracted”.</li>
<li>Press the “Extract Data” button.</li>
</ul>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/first_start_with_extraction.gif"
alt="First start with Extraction" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">First start with Extraction</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There are several options to extract the game files:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extract only needed data - this will extract only the data needed
for the tool to work. It will be faster than the full extraction.</li>
<li>Verify extracted data - this will check the consistency of the
extracted data. Recommended to use it every time you extract the
data.</li>
<li>Overwrite existing files - this will overwrite the existing files in
the output folder. Again, recommended to use it every time you extract
the data.</li>
<li>Set as source and load after extraction - this will set the
extracted folder as the source for the game data and load it after the
extraction.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can see unselect some DLC’s, if you don’t want to
extract them.</p>
<h4 id="loading-the-mods-with-the-game-data-and-dlcs">Loading the Mods
with the Game Data and DLC’s</h4>
<p>On the options page there is a checkbox which allows you to load the
mods with the game data and DLC’s. This is useful if you want to work
with the mods in the tool. The mods will be loaded from the
<code>extensions</code> folder in the game data. Can be extracted the
same way as the game data and DCL’s.</p>
<p>Available from <code>version 0.7.0</code>. Updated in
<code>version 0.8.1</code>.</p>
<h5 id="data-loading-important-notice">Data Loading Important
Notice</h5>
<p>From <code>version 0.7.0</code> the tool requires the
<code>content.xml</code> files for the DLC’s and Mods in the extracted
game data. The tool will extract them automatically for DLC’s. If you
have an extracted data by previous version of a tool (before
<code>v0.7.0</code>)- please repeat the process.</p>
<h3 id="main-window">Main Window</h3>
<p>After starting, you will see the main window with a list of
connections and an area to define a gate connection, i.e., two areas to
define the gates in the two sectors. The new gates are already shown on
the map in the default position in the sector center.</p>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/main_window.png" alt="Main window" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Main window</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="connection-editing-area">Connection Editing Area</h4>
<h5 id="direct-sector-selection-and-simple-map">Direct Sector Selection
and Simple Map</h5>
<p>To start, simply select any sector from the list in the
<code>Direct Sector</code> group. Then the items from the selected
sector will be displayed on the raw and simple sector map and as a list
on the right side of the map.</p>
<p>Existing gates are displayed as yellow gate icons from the game. Gold
ones are from the currently edited mod. Green represents the currently
edited gate. In addition, the SuperHighway gate and stations from the
god.xml will be displayed. The background of the sector map matches the
color of the sector owner in the game.</p>
<h5 id="define-gate-location">Define Gate Location</h5>
<p>You can define the gate location by pressing the left mouse button on
the gate and moving it to the desired location. A more precise position
can be set by entering the coordinates and rotation angles. Please note
that the coordinates are split into two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coordinates themselves, in km (this is the appropriate zone position
in the sector).</li>
<li>Position - the position from the coordinates point in meters (this
is the position of the gate in the zone).</li>
</ul>
<p>To simplify editing, the position part is randomly prefilled on
sector selection.</p>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/define_direct_sector.gif"
alt="Define Direct sector" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Define Direct sector</figcaption>
</figure>
<h6 id="gate-rotation">Gate Rotation</h6>
<p>The rotation of the gate can be defined using three angles: Yaw,
Pitch and Roll.</p>
<p><strong>Pitch is the most important one</strong>, as it defines the
direction the gate is facing in the sector. Yaw and Roll are generally
not needed for most cases, but can be used for specific scenarios.</p>
<p>Here is an explanation of each:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Yaw</strong>: This is just the clockwise/counterclockwise
rotation of the ring. A value of 90 would put the side pods of the ring
at the top and bottom instead and so is also generally unnecessary and
can be left at 0 in most cases.</li>
<li><strong>Pitch</strong>: This is the left/right rotation of the ring
and is the one to actually use if you want to face the ring in a certain
direction on the map. A Pitch of 0 degrees has the ring facing North and
the connection line on the map coming out of the south side of the ring.
+45 degrees has the ring turn right to face North-East with the map line
going to the South-West. While ship traffic doesn’t care which way the
map line is facing, it does make the map a bit wild and unnecessarily
cluttered if it’s facing the wrong way. Also, you can’t enter more than
180 degrees in the box, so if you want to face west you must use a
negative value. And oddly, you can’t type in a negative sign (-) without
a value already in the box. For example, -135 would face the gate
South-West with the map line going North-East.</li>
<li><strong>Roll</strong>: This is the forward/backward pitch of the
gate and so is generally unneeded unless the gate is well above or below
the plane of the sector. It can typically just be left at 0.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="extended-sector-map">Extended Sector Map</h5>
<p>If the current sector map size is too small for you, you can press
the appropriate button to open the extended sector map. On this map, you
can set the gate location in the same way as on the simple map, but more
precisely.</p>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/extended_sector_map.gif"
alt="Extended sector map" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Extended sector map</figcaption>
</figure>
<h5 id="sector-real-size-slider">Sector “Real” Size Slider</h5>
<p>Under the sector map, there is a slider to change the sector map
“real” size. This is effectively the scale of the sector map.</p>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/sector_scale_slider.gif"
alt="Sector scale slider" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Sector scale slider</figcaption>
</figure>
<h5 id="other-gate-data">Other Gate Data</h5>
<p>You can define rotation angles for the gate and set the status of the
gate. For some reason, you can deactivate it (if you plan to use it in
your own scenarios).</p>
<h4 id="opposite-sector-selection">Opposite Sector Selection</h4>
<p>Now you can select the second sector and define the gate location in
it.</p>
<p>Please note that in the selection list for the second
(<code>Opposite Sector</code>), some sectors will be grayed out and not
available for selection. This is because the sector is already selected
as the first sector or they already have a connection with the
<code>Direct Sector</code>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/define_opposite_sector.gif"
alt="Select opposite sector" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Select opposite sector</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After defining the gate in the second sector, you can add the
connection to the list.</p>
<h4 id="add-gates-connection">Add Gates Connection</h4>
<p>Simply press the <code>Add</code> button.</p>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/add_gates_connection.gif"
alt="Add gates connection" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Add gates connection</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The connection will be added to the list. You can see the connection
in the list and still edit it.</p>
<h4 id="modify-existing-connection">Modify Existing Connection</h4>
<p>If you move the gate in the sector for the existing connection, you
will see two “identical” gates on the map. One (<code>gold</code>) is
the gate from the connection, and the other (<code>green</code>) is the
gate in the new location.</p>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/update_gates_connection.gif"
alt="Gate from connection moved to the new position" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Gate from connection moved to the new
position</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="connection-editing-area-buttons">Connection Editing Area
Buttons</h4>
<p>There are two buttons at the bottom of the window:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Add/Update</code> - to add the gate connection to the list. We
already discussed it.</li>
<li><code>Reset</code> - to reset the gate data fields to the default
values. See below for more information.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="reset-button">Reset Button</h5>
<p>If you have no selected gate connection in the list, the reset button
will reset all gate connection-related information to the defaults,
mostly empty or zero values.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it will reset the gate data fields to the values of the
selected connection.</p>
<h4 id="map-objects-tooltips">Map Objects Tooltips</h4>
<p>You can hover over the map objects to view additional information
about them, such as their status, coordinates, and related connections.
This feature helps in better understanding the relationships between
different gates and sectors.</p>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/map_objects_tooltips.gif"
alt="Map objects tooltips" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Map objects tooltips</figcaption>
</figure>
<h4 id="galaxy-map">Galaxy Map</h4>
<p>The Galaxy Map allows you to navigate through various sectors in the
game. You can zoom in and out to view details about each sector and the
gates within them. Using the map, you can select sectors to use in the
gate connections.</p>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/galaxy_map.gif" alt="Galaxy map" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Galaxy map</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For zooming, there are two options available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the slider at the top of the map.</li>
<li>Use the mouse wheel while holding the <code>Ctrl</code> key.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, you can drag the map with the left mouse button when it
is zoomed in.</p>
<p>When you click the left mouse button on a sector, it will be selected
as the direct or opposite sector in the connection. If the selected
sector is not available for the connection, like grayed-out sectors in
the dropdown lists, the tool will do nothing.</p>
<p>Note: If you cannot see the sector you need on a map, but is is
available in the list - it is probably because the located in cluster
which coordinates cannot be aligned to the hexagonal grid. It will be a
possible problem in appropriate Mod or DLC.</p>
<h5 id="clusters-and-sectors-tooltips">Clusters and sectors
tooltips</h5>
<p>You can hover over the clusters and sectors on the map to view
additional information about them:</p>
<ul>
<li>For clusters you can see a name, macro and coordinates.</li>
<li>For sectors you can see a name, owner, sunlight, economy, security,
macro and coordinates. Additionally information about parent cluster is
shown.</li>
</ul>
<figure>

<h5 id="hiding-and-showing-the-dlcs-and-mods-on-a-map">Hiding and
showing the DLC’s and Mods on a map</h5>
<p>You can toggle the visibility of DLCs and Mods on the map to focus on
your current editing tasks. This feature allows you to clearly see the
connections you are working on without distractions from additional
content. Use the map options menu to show or hide these elements
according to your needs.</p>

<p>You can toggle the visibility of empty cluster cells on the map. This
feature allows you to see the empty cells where a new cluster can be
placed. Use the map options menu to show or hide these elements
according to your needs. Additionally, you will have the possibility to
see the coordinates of such cells on the appropriate tooltip.</p>

<h3 id="save-the-mod">Save the Mod</h3>
<p>When you finish with the connections, you can save the mod via the
<code>Mod</code> -&gt; <code>Save</code> menu item. Please ensure you
have completed all necessary edits before saving to avoid losing data.
If the connections are not finalized, the save option may be
disabled.</p>
<p>Please note that if you have not finished editing the connections,
this menu item will be disabled. Save the current connection or reset it
to have the ability to save the mod.</p>
<p>After selecting the <code>Save</code> menu item, the tool will ask
you to select the output folder for the mod.</p>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/saving_the_mod.gif" alt="Saving the mod" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Saving the mod</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After that, the mod is ready to be installed in the game.</p>
<h3 id="load-the-mod">Load the Mod</h3>
<p>If you have a previously saved mod, you can load it via the
<code>Mod</code> -&gt; <code>Load</code> menu item. The difference from
saving the mod is that you have to select the <code>content.xml</code>
file in the mod root folder in contrast to selecting the output folder.
This was made to avoid selecting the wrong folder.</p>
<figure>
<img src="docs/images/loading_the_mod.gif" alt="Loading the mod" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Loading the mod</figcaption>
